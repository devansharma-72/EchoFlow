## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Node.js** (for the frontend)
2. **Python 3.8+** (for the backend)
3. **MongoDB** (for database storage)

---

### **Step 1: Install Node.js**
Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can install it using **nvm** (Node Version Manager):

#### **Install with nvm**
```bash
# Install nvm (if not already installed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash

# Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
nvm install --lts

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
```

---

### **Step 2: Clone and Set Up the Project**
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EchoFlow.git
cd EchoFlow
```

---

### **Step 3: Set Up the Backend**
The backend is built with **Flask** and requires a virtual environment for dependency management.

#### **1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### **2. Install Backend Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following keys:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

#### **4. Run the Backend**
```bash
flask run
```

---

### **Step 4: Set Up the Frontend**
The frontend is built with **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.

#### **1. Install Frontend Dependencies**
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` folder and add the following keys:

```plaintext
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
```

#### **3. Run the Frontend**
```bash
npm run dev
```
